## 2025-02-05 - Semantic Lists in React
**Learning:** React components (especially shadcn/ui Cards) often use `div` soups for lists. Converting them to `ul`/`li` with proper `aria-current` attributes significantly improves screen reader navigation without visual changes.
**Action:** Always check "list-like" components (player lists, feeds, inventories) and convert to semantic HTML lists.
