## 2026-01-16 - [Blocking Selection Prevents Information Access]
**Learning:** Preventing selection of "completed" or "owned" items (like territories) blocks users from inspecting them, which is a major accessibility barrier if status is conveyed only by color.
**Action:** Always allow selection/inspection of entities, even if the primary action (claiming) is disabled. Provide clear status text ("Claimed by X") alongside visual indicators.
